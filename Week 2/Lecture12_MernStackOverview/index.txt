Overview
MERN stack is a JavaScript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of
full stack web applications. MERN Stack comprises of four technologies namely
MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. It is designed to make the development

MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of
key-value pairs that are similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects.
MongoDB is flexible and allows its users to create schema, databases, tables, etc.
Documents that are identifiable by a primary key make up the basic unit of
MongoDB. Once MongoDB is installed, users can make use of Mongo shell as
well. Mongo shell provides a JavaScript interface through which the users can
interact and carry out operations (eg: querying, updating records, deleting
records).
