## The MERN stack is a powerful combination of technologies used to build modern web applications. It includes:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build robust backend servers.
React: A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces, developed by Facebook.
Node.js: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting.

Together, these technologies provide a full-stack development environment that allows developers to create scalable and maintainable web applications.
